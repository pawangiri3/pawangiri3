## 💼 Signature Project — Telecom & Zero-Downtime Migration

**Project:** Zero-downtime migration & deployment for a US-based telecom client

**Summary:**

* Designed and provisioned infrastructure for a carrier-grade telecom application on Azure.
* Deployed and integrated Nokia network functions (HSS/HLR, SDL, AUSF-UDM) as cloud-native network functions (CNF).
* Implemented CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation to ensure zero downtime during cutover.
* Performed integration testing, handover, and live traffic migration from legacy systems to the new CNF environment.

**My responsibilities & achievements:**

* End-to-end infrastructure provisioning (Terraform + Azure resources).
* Containerized telecom components and created Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts.
* Implemented GitOps-style deployment with ArgoCD for reliable rollouts and fast rollbacks.
* Built Azure & GitHub Actions pipelines to automate build, test, and deploy stages.
* Implemented monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) and alerts for service-level visibility.
* Executed traffic migration strategy to move production traffic with zero customer-impact.

## 📁 Projects & Repo Suggestions (what to add to GitHub)

Create separate repos for each major area so recruiters can quickly scan your work:

1. `infra-azure-terraform` — Modular Terraform for VPC/network, AKS (or managed k8s), storage, IAM roles. Include `README.md`, module examples, and a `state` backend example (remote backend hints).
2. `k8s-telecom-cnf` — Kubernetes manifests + Helm charts for the Nokia CNF components you deployed (HSS/HLR, SDL, AUSF-UDM). Include deployment strategy documentation and README with architecture diagrams.
3. `ci-cd-pipelines` — Example Azure Pipelines + GitHub Actions workflows used for the project. Provide clear pipeline YAMLs and explanation for each stage (build, test, deploy, smoke tests).
4. `monitoring-observability` — Prometheus and Grafana setup, alert rules, example dashboards, and runbook for incident response.
5. `automation-scripts` — Useful bash / python scripts you wrote for automation, migration tasks, and integration testing.

Each repo should include:

* Clear README with one-line summary, architecture diagram, and how to run/test locally.
* `LICENSE` (MIT/Apache) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you want external contributions.
* `/.github/workflows/` for CI examples.

## ✅ Quick Tips to Keep It Professional

* Keep language concise and formal.
* Use `architecture diagrams` (PNG/SVG) showing cloud, k8s clusters, and dataflow.
* Add `reproducible examples` and `how-to` steps so recruiters can run things locally.
* Add `release notes` or a short `project highlights` section for each repo.
* Pin the 4–6 most relevant repos on your GitHub profile (infra, k8s, ci-cd, monitoring).
